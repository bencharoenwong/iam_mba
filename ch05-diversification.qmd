# Session 05: Diversification — The Only Free Lunch

Harry Markowitz called diversification the only free lunch in finance. That is not a throwaway line. In most markets, getting more of something good requires paying for it — higher expected return means accepting more risk. Diversification is the rare exception: you can reduce risk without giving up expected return, simply by combining assets that do not move together perfectly. The math is elementary; what is remarkable is how consistently investors fail to act on it. Most retail portfolios are badly underdiversified. Many professional portfolios are less diversified than their managers believe. And even sophisticated institutions routinely confuse holding a large number of positions with actually being diversified. This session builds the conceptual and mathematical foundation for understanding why diversification works, what its limits are, and what "properly diversified" actually means in practice.

We open Theme 2 of the course — Investing as a Science. The previous sessions established that markets are largely, but not perfectly, efficient, and that investor behavior regularly deviates from what theory predicts. This session shifts the focus: even setting aside whether you can pick good stocks, how should you combine whatever assets you own? That question is portfolio construction, and diversification is its central principle.

## Risk Preferences and the Utility of Wealth

Before we can talk about how to construct portfolios, we need a framework for thinking about what investors actually want. The standard model makes four assumptions that together define a risk-averse investor:

1. More wealth is preferred to less.
2. Less risk is preferred to more risk, all else equal.
3. Each additional dollar of wealth produces a bit less satisfaction than the previous dollar — diminishing marginal utility.
4. Tolerance for risk tends to increase with wealth.
5. Losses hurt more than equivalent gains feel good — loss aversion.

These assumptions are not a precise description of how any individual actually thinks. They are an approximation — useful precisely because they let us build tractable models. The goal is a framework that "makes sense" as a first-order characterization of investor behavior and that generates useful predictions, not a literal psychological model.

The standard utility function used in portfolio theory takes the form:

$$U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2} A \sigma^2$$

where $E(r)$ is expected return, $\sigma^2$ is portfolio variance, and $A$ is a parameter capturing the investor's degree of risk aversion. Higher $A$ means the investor penalizes variance more heavily. The factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ is a mathematical convenience — it simplifies the first-order conditions when we optimize later.

What this expression says is intuitive: investors value expected returns but are willing to trade them off against variance. A more risk-averse investor (higher $A$) requires higher expected return to accept the same level of risk. An investor with $A = 0$ is risk-neutral and cares only about expected return.

## Academic Reference

The mean-variance utility framework originates with Markowitz (1952) and was subsequently axiomatized by von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). The specific form $U = E(r) - \frac{1}{2} A \sigma^2$ is an approximation valid when returns are normally distributed or when the investor has quadratic utility. The parameter $A$ can be estimated empirically from surveys or inferred from observed portfolio choices; common estimates for typical retail investors range from about 2 to 4. Bodie, Kane, and Marcus, Chapter 6, provides the full derivation.
:::

There is a real tension embedded in these assumptions that the model glosses over. Behavioral finance tells us that assumption five — loss aversion — is roughly twice as strong as the model implies. People are loss-averse in a way that is not well-captured by diminishing marginal utility alone; the disutility from a $1,000 loss is psychologically much larger than the utility from a $1,000 gain, even when wealth levels are identical. We will return to this. For now, the mean-variance framework gives us the tools we need.

## The Mathematics of Portfolio Risk

::: {.callout-note}
## Quick Refresher — Variance, Standard Deviation, Correlation
**Variance** ($\sigma^2$) measures how spread out returns are around the average — it is the average squared deviation from the mean. **Standard deviation** ($\sigma$) is its square root, expressed in the same units as the return itself. A stock with a 20% standard deviation typically swings roughly ±20% around its average return in a given year. **Covariance** measures how two returns move together in absolute terms; **correlation** ($\rho$) rescales covariance to a -1 to +1 range, making it easier to compare across asset pairs. Correlation of 1.0 means lockstep; -1.0 means exactly opposite; 0 means no linear relationship. These are the building blocks of everything that follows.
:::

Consider a portfolio of two assets, $A$ and $B$, with weights $w$ and $(1 - w)$ respectively. The expected return is linear in the weights:

$$E(r_p) = w \cdot E(r_A) + (1 - w) \cdot E(r_B)$$

Portfolio variance, however, is not linear in the weights. It picks up a cross term:

$$\sigma_p^2 = w^2 \sigma_A^2 + (1 - w)^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2 w (1-w) \sigma_{AB}$$

where $\sigma_{AB} = \text{Cov}(r_A, r_B) = \rho_{AB} \cdot \sigma_A \cdot \sigma_B$, and $\rho_{AB}$ is the correlation between the two assets.

The diversification benefit is captured by a simple inequality: when $\rho_{AB} < 1$,

$$
\sigma_p < w \cdot \sigma_A + (1-w) \cdot \sigma_B
$$

Portfolio standard deviation is strictly less than the weighted average of individual standard deviations. The gap between the two sides is the free lunch.

This formula is the mathematical reason diversification works. The expected return of the portfolio is a weighted average of the component expected returns — you get nothing extra, but you give nothing up. Portfolio variance, by contrast, depends critically on $\rho_{AB}$. When assets are imperfectly correlated ($\rho < 1$), the portfolio variance is strictly less than the weighted average of the individual variances. You are getting the same expected return with less risk. That is the free lunch.

The extreme cases are instructive:

- When $\rho_{AB} = 1$: perfect positive correlation. The portfolio standard deviation equals the weighted average of the individual standard deviations. No diversification benefit whatsoever.
- When $\rho_{AB} = -1$: perfect negative correlation. For the right portfolio weights, the variance drops to zero. You can construct a riskless portfolio from two risky assets. In practice, no two assets have $\rho = -1$ over long horizons, but this is the theoretical limit.
- When $\rho_{AB} = 0$: uncorrelated assets. Portfolio variance falls materially. Holding equal weights, $\sigma_p^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sigma_A^2 + \sigma_B^2}{2}$ approximately — roughly half the average individual variance.

## Practitioner Insight

The correlation between two assets is not constant. It changes over time, and — critically — it tends to increase precisely when you most need it to fall. During the 2008 financial crisis, correlations across most equity sectors converged toward 1. The same happened in March 2020. When volatility spikes, investors sell what they can, not what they want to — triggering correlated drawdowns across positions that looked uncorrelated in calm periods. A portfolio that looks diversified based on historical correlations estimated during low-volatility periods can behave like a concentrated bet during the precise scenarios where diversification matters most.
:::

## Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risk

Extend the two-asset logic to $N$ assets, and something fundamental emerges. The total risk of a portfolio can always be decomposed into two components:

$$\underbrace{\sigma_p^2}_{\text{Portfolio risk}} = \underbrace{\text{Systematic risk}}_{\text{Non-diversifiable}} + \underbrace{\text{Idiosyncratic risk}}_{\text{Diversifiable}}$$

More precisely, for an equally weighted portfolio of $N$ assets, portfolio variance is approximately:

$$\sigma_p^2 \approx \bar{\sigma}_{ii} \cdot \frac{1}{N} + \bar{\sigma}_{ij} \cdot \frac{N-1}{N}$$

where $\bar{\sigma}_{ii}$ is the average individual variance and $\bar{\sigma}_{ij}$ is the average pairwise covariance. As $N \to \infty$, the first term vanishes and portfolio variance converges to $\bar{\sigma}_{ij}$ — the average covariance. That floor is systematic risk: the component that cannot be eliminated no matter how many assets you add.

::: {.callout-note}
## Derivation: Portfolio Variance with N Equally Weighted Assets

For an equally weighted portfolio ($w_i = 1/N$ for all $i$):

$$
\sigma_p^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} w_i w_j \sigma_{ij} = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \sigma_{ij}
$$

Separate the diagonal terms ($i = j$) from the off-diagonal terms ($i \neq j$):

$$
= \frac{1}{N^2} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sigma_{ii} + \sum_{i \neq j} \sigma_{ij} \right]
= \frac{1}{N^2} \left[ N \bar{\sigma}_{ii} + N(N-1) \bar{\sigma}_{ij} \right]
$$

$$
= \frac{\bar{\sigma}_{ii}}{N} + \frac{N-1}{N} \bar{\sigma}_{ij}
$$

As $N \to \infty$: the first term $\to 0$ (idiosyncratic risk vanishes) and the second term $\to \bar{\sigma}_{ij}$ (systematic risk remains). This is why diversification has a *floor* — you cannot eliminate market-wide risk by adding more stocks.
:::

This decomposition is captured elegantly through the return-generating model:

$$r_i = E(r_i) + \beta_i \cdot F + \epsilon_i$$

where $F$ is a systematic factor (macroeconomic surprises, for example), $\beta_i$ is the asset's sensitivity to that factor, and $\epsilon_i$ is the idiosyncratic component unique to firm $i$. The $\epsilon_i$ terms are uncorrelated across firms by definition. When you hold a diversified portfolio, the $\epsilon_i$ terms average out — they cancel each other. What remains is the shared exposure to $F$ multiplied by the weighted average $\beta$ of the portfolio. That exposure cannot be eliminated.

Systematic risk includes things like: changes in interest rates affecting all bond prices, a recession reducing earnings broadly, a global pandemic shutting down economic activity. Idiosyncratic risk includes: the unexpected death of a founder, a product recall, a fraud scandal, a lawsuit. The former affects everyone. The latter affects one firm. When you are diversified, firm-specific events matter much less — the impact of any single firm's bad news is diluted across hundreds of positions.

::: {.callout-important}
## Common Misconception

Diversification eliminates idiosyncratic risk, not risk. This seems obvious but leads to a critical implication: in a world where all investors are rational and can diversify, the market should not reward you for bearing idiosyncratic risk. You are taking a risk that you could have eliminated for free. The market therefore prices only systematic risk — the component that survives diversification. This logic is the foundation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which we cover in the next session. The implication for practice: concentrating your portfolio in a few stocks because you "know them well" means bearing idiosyncratic risk that you are almost certainly not being compensated for.

## Real-World Case: Enron and the Cost of Concentration

In December 2000, Enron was the seventh-largest company in the United States by revenue. Its stock traded above $80. Employees were encouraged to hold Enron stock in their 401(k) retirement accounts, and many did — enthusiastically. By some estimates, over 60% of the average Enron employee's retirement savings were in company stock.

When Enron filed for bankruptcy in December 2001 — following the revelation of massive accounting fraud — the stock fell to under $1. Employees lost an estimated $1.2 billion in retirement savings. Many were in their 50s and 60s with no time to recover.

The financial lesson is a direct application of the idiosyncratic-versus-systematic distinction. Enron employees had concentrated exposure to a single firm's idiosyncratic risk — *and* that risk was correlated with their human capital (their jobs). When the firm failed, they lost both their income and their savings simultaneously. A diversified portfolio would not have prevented the job loss, but it would have preserved the retirement savings. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was passed partly in response, giving employees the right to diversify out of company stock in their retirement plans.

## How Many Stocks Do You Actually Need?

The empirical answer to this question has been studied carefully. The key paper is Statman (1987), which shows that the benefits of diversification are largely exhausted by somewhere between 30 and 40 stocks, though the exact number depends on what level of residual idiosyncratic risk you find acceptable.

The curve is sharply convex. Going from 1 stock to 2 eliminates roughly 46% of the diversifiable risk. Going from 2 to 3 eliminates another 22%. By the time you reach 20 stocks, you have removed perhaps 95% of the idiosyncratic risk that was available to remove. Adding the 21st stock gives you very little incremental benefit. The marginal diversification benefit declines rapidly.

## Worked Example: Diversification with Two Stocks

Suppose Stock A has expected return 10% and standard deviation 25%, and Stock B has expected return 8% and standard deviation 20%. You invest 60% in A and 40% in B.

**Expected return** is straightforward:
$$E(r_p) = 0.6 \times 10\% + 0.4 \times 8\% = 9.2\%$$

**Portfolio risk** depends critically on the correlation $\rho_{AB}$:

| Correlation ($\rho$) | Portfolio Std Dev ($\sigma_p$) | Risk Reduction vs. Weighted Avg |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1.0 | 23.0% | 0% |
| 0.5 | 20.2% | 12.2% |
| 0.0 | 17.1% | 25.7% |
| −0.5 | 13.3% | 42.2% |

The weighted average of individual standard deviations is $0.6 \times 25\% + 0.4 \times 20\% = 23.0\%$. At $\rho = 0.5$ — a typical correlation between two stocks in different sectors — portfolio risk drops to 20.2%, a meaningful reduction achieved simply by holding both rather than concentrating in one. At $\rho = 0$, the reduction is even larger.

**Calculation for** $\rho = 0.5$:
$$\sigma_p^2 = (0.6)^2(0.25)^2 + (0.4)^2(0.20)^2 + 2(0.6)(0.4)(0.5)(0.25)(0.20)$$
$$= 0.0225 + 0.0064 + 0.012 = 0.0409$$
$$\sigma_p = \sqrt{0.0409} = 20.2\%$$

The free lunch: expected return stayed at 9.2% regardless of correlation, but risk fell from 23.0% to 20.2% — a 12% reduction from diversification alone.
:::

But here is the catch from Lesson 1 of portfolio mathematics: the number of stocks is not the right metric. What matters is the correlation structure. Fifty internet stocks in 2000 provided almost no diversification. They were all sensitive to the same factor — the re-rating of growth expectations for technology companies. When that factor reversed, they fell together. A portfolio of 10 stocks spanning genuinely different industries and geographies may well be more diversified than a portfolio of 50 stocks concentrated in one sector.

The practical implication is that diversification requires thinking about the *correlation structure* of what you own, not just counting positions. Two diagnostic questions: What macro factor would destroy this portfolio? How correlated are the holdings relative to that factor?

## Academic Reference

Statman (1987) in the *Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis* is the definitive study on optimal portfolio size for U.S. stocks. Goetzmann and Kumar (2008) in the *Review of Finance* document that retail investors hold severely underdiversified portfolios — typically 3 to 4 stocks — and that this underdiversification is costly, reducing their risk-adjusted returns substantially. The finding is not that retail investors hold too few stocks per se, but that the stocks they hold are highly correlated with each other, reflecting familiarity bias rather than genuine diversification.

## Diversification Creates Staying Power

There is a behavioral argument for diversification that is distinct from the mathematical one, and it matters enormously in practice.

Concentrated portfolios fail not only because of the mathematics of risk — they fail because most investors cannot psychologically tolerate the volatility they generate. A portfolio of three stocks can easily be down 40% in a year on firm-specific bad news. That kind of drawdown triggers panic selling. It creates permanent psychological trauma. Behavioral economics tells us that the pain of loss is roughly twice as intense as the pleasure of equivalent gain — which means a portfolio that swings violently creates massive psychological disutility even if the long-run expected return is the same as a diversified portfolio.

A diversified portfolio provides what practitioners call *staying power*: the psychological capacity to remain invested through inevitable periods of drawdown. The mathematics of long-run compounding are unforgiving — missing the best 10 days of a 20-year market cycle dramatically reduces terminal wealth. But you can only capture the long-run return if you actually stay invested. Diversification makes that easier by smoothing the return path, reducing the magnitude of individual position collapses, and ensuring that some part of the portfolio is working even when another is not.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Practitioner Insight

This is where John Bogle's observation about asset allocation deserves serious attention. He cited research showing that the allocation decision — how much to hold in equities versus bonds versus cash — explains roughly 94% of the variance in long-run portfolio returns across pension funds. Not stock selection. Not market timing.

This finding — from Brinson, Hood, and Beebower (1986) — is frequently misinterpreted. The 93.6% figure refers to how much of a fund's *time-series* return variation is explained by its policy asset allocation (strategic benchmark), not how much of the *cross-sectional* difference in returns across funds is due to asset allocation. The time-series result is almost trivially true: of course a 60/40 fund's returns look like 60% stocks and 40% bonds most of the time. The cross-sectional question — "does choosing 70/30 versus 50/50 matter more than choosing good managers?" — is more nuanced and has a less dramatic answer, with asset allocation explaining roughly 40% of cross-fund return differences in the Ibbotson and Kaplan (2000) follow-up.

The decision to hold a diversified equity portfolio and stay in it through volatility is the single most important investment decision most people will ever make. The alpha from stock selection, on average, is noise. The beta from staying invested in a diversified portfolio is real.
:::

The behavioral case for diversification intersects with a practical observation about concentrated positions: investors in concentrated portfolios make systematically worse decisions around them. They anchor to purchase prices. They interpret temporary price declines as confirmation that their thesis is correct — buying more when they should be asking hard questions. They experience career risk and social pressure in ways that distort judgment. A concentrated position in a stock that has declined 60% from purchase creates a psychological profile — anxiety, loss aversion, denial — that is not conducive to clear-eyed investment analysis. A diversified portfolio makes each individual position small enough that you can think about it clearly.

## International Diversification

If diversification within an asset class is valuable, diversification across countries should be even more so — the correlations between markets are lower than correlations within markets, and the macro factors affecting, say, Brazilian equities are substantially different from those affecting Japanese equities.

In theory, this is straightforward. In practice, international diversification confronts real frictions:

**Capital controls and market access.** Many emerging markets place restrictions on the amount of capital that can flow in or out. India caps overseas mutual fund investment through regulation. China maintains a two-tier market structure that effectively segments domestic from international investors. These constraints are not merely technical inconveniences — they represent genuine limits on what an international portfolio can achieve.

**Currency risk.** Holding Japanese equities in a USD-denominated portfolio introduces yen/dollar exposure. Whether to hedge this exposure is a genuine decision with real costs. Currency forwards and options are not free, and the carry cost of systematic hedging erodes a significant portion of the diversification benefit in some markets.

**Information asymmetry.** The home bias documented in the market efficiency session is partly explained by information advantages — local investors know their markets better. The counterargument is that for large-cap stocks in liquid markets, this advantage has largely been arbitraged away.

**Correlation dynamics.** Emerging market correlations with developed market equities were consistently lower through the 1990s. As global capital flows grew and financial integration deepened, those correlations increased. They jumped sharply during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the 1998 LTCM crisis, the 2008 global financial crisis, and the 2020 pandemic selloff. Global diversification provides genuine benefits in normal times but less benefit precisely when you most need it.

## Exam/Career Relevance

A common interview question at asset management firms: "How would you advise a client who holds most of their wealth in the stock of the company they work for?" This is a concentrated, undiversified position with correlated human capital risk — if the company fails, the client loses both their job and their savings simultaneously. The right answer requires explaining idiosyncratic versus systematic risk, the psychological barriers to diversifying concentrated positions (tax bills, anchoring, emotional attachment), and practical implementation strategies (collars, exchange funds, staged liquidation). Be prepared to walk through the mathematical reasoning clearly.
:::

## The Limits of Diversification

Diversification is powerful but not unlimited. Several structural constraints prevent full diversification even in theory:

**Transaction costs and minimum position sizes.** Building a genuinely diversified portfolio across 200 securities requires either significant capital (to maintain positions worth trading) or acceptance of trading costs that erode returns. ETFs largely solve this for retail investors — a single S&P 500 ETF purchase gives you instant diversification across 500 companies at near-zero cost. This is one of the most consequential financial innovations of the past 50 years.

**Systematic risk is irreducible.** As shown mathematically, diversification drives portfolio variance toward the average pairwise covariance, not toward zero. In a world with common macro factors — interest rate cycles, business cycles, inflation shocks — there will always be residual systematic risk that no amount of stock-picking or portfolio construction can eliminate. The question is whether you are being compensated for bearing it.

**Diversification across asset classes has limits in crisis.** Holding equities plus bonds plus real estate plus commodities is often presented as the gold standard of diversification. During the 2022 rate shock, all four major asset classes fell simultaneously. When the driving factor is a shift in the risk-free rate, everything re-prices in the same direction. The correlation structure that holds in normal conditions is not the one that holds in stress.

**Concentration is sometimes intentional.** Warren Buffett's famous counter to the diversification principle — "keep all your eggs in one basket, but watch that basket closely" — is not simply wrong. For investors with genuine information advantages in specific companies, concentration reflects the economic value of that information. The problem is that most investors who think they have such advantages do not. The empirical evidence is consistent: retail investors who trade actively on perceived information advantages underperform diversified passive strategies, net of costs. Buffett's approach is defensible for Buffett. It is not a template.

Strategic asset allocation across major classes — domestic equities, international equities, fixed income, real estate, commodities, alternatives — is the practical extension of diversification to the full investment opportunity set. The correlation structure across these classes, their historical return and volatility patterns, and their liquidity characteristics are inputs to the optimization problem we examine in the next session.

## Key Takeaways

- Diversification reduces portfolio risk without reducing expected return — the "free lunch" arises because imperfect correlations cause the cross terms in the variance formula to reduce total variance.
- Total portfolio risk decomposes into systematic (undiversifiable) and idiosyncratic (diversifiable) components. Rational investors should not bear idiosyncratic risk because they can eliminate it for free.
- The diversification benefit is largely exhausted by 30–40 stocks, but counting stocks is the wrong metric — what matters is the correlation structure and factor exposure. Fifty correlated positions provide no more diversification than five.
- Diversification is not just a mathematical tool — it creates staying power by making portfolios psychologically manageable through drawdowns, which is often what determines long-run investment outcomes.
- International diversification offers genuine benefits in normal markets, but correlations increase precisely during crises, limiting the protection when it is most needed.

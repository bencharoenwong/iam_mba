# Preface {.unnumbered}

These lecture notes are adapted from the **Investments and Asset Management** course taught at INSEAD's Singapore campus during January--February 2025. The course is designed for MBA students and covers 14 sessions organized around four themes:

1. **Investing as a Human Problem** --- the asset management industry, financial planning, behavioral biases, market efficiency, and the democratization of finance
2. **Investing as a Science** --- diversification, modern portfolio theory, active vs. passive management, factor investing
3. **Investing as an Art** --- active strategies, security selection, risk management, and the role of practitioner judgment
4. **State of the Art** --- ESG and sustainability, alternative investments, AI in asset management

Each chapter corresponds to one lecture session, covering all 14 sessions in the course. Chapters built from lecture transcripts preserve the conversational style, real-world examples, and class discussions from the original lectures. Chapters derived primarily from lecture slides present the same frameworks and concepts in a more structured format.

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter corresponds to one lecture session. The chapter numbers match the original session numbers for easy cross-referencing with course materials. Within each chapter you will find:

- **Core concepts** structured around the session's guiding questions
- **Practical examples** drawn from real markets, funds, and current events
- **Key takeaways** summarizing the most important points
- **Further reading** for those who want to go deeper

::: {.callout-note}
These notes are meant to complement---not replace---the original course materials, readings, and in-class exercises. They work best as a review resource alongside the assigned readings listed at the end of each chapter.

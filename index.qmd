# Preface {.unnumbered}

These lecture notes are adapted from the **Investments and Asset Management** course taught at INSEAD's Singapore campus during January--February 2026. The course is designed for MBA students and covers 14 sessions organized around four themes:

1. **Investing as a Human Problem** --- the asset management industry, financial planning, behavioral biases, market efficiency, and the democratization of finance
2. **Investing as a Science** --- diversification, modern portfolio theory, active vs. passive management, factor investing
3. **Investing as an Art** --- active strategies, security selection, risk management, and the role of practitioner judgment
4. **State of the Art** --- ESG and sustainability, alternative investments, AI in asset management

Each chapter corresponds to one lecture session, covering all 14 sessions in the course. Chapters built from lecture transcripts preserve the conversational style, real-world examples, and class discussions from the original lectures. Chapters derived primarily from lecture slides present the same frameworks and concepts in a more structured format.

## Course Overview

The course aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to critically evaluate investment theories and apply them to real-world scenarios beyond a textbook treatment. By engaging with current market issues and debates, students develop the ability to make informed investment decisions and navigate the asset management industry effectively.
